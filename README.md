Hey. I’m CJ. A San Francisco–based software engineer working across machine learning, data engineering, and full-stack development. I build end-to-end AI systems that combine fine-tuned LLMs, scalable data pipelines, and modern web applications.

My work spans everything from LoRA training and model serving to backend APIs, data processing pipelines, and React front ends. I love taking ideas from zero to production and designing systems where models, data, and user experience all come together cleanly.

I’m especially interested in ethical, human-centered AI and enjoy building tools that help people learn, work, and create more effectively.

Here you’ll find projects involving:

LLM fine-tuning & model deployment

Data pipelines & analytics

FastAPI / Flask backends

React front-end interfaces

Dockerized local development

Experiments with retrieval, embeddings, and inference systems

Always open to collaborating, learning something new, or exploring interesting technical problems.
