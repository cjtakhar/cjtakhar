## Hey, I’m CJ.

I'm a **San Francisco–based software engineer** working across  
**machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **full-stack development**.  
I build **end to end AI systems** that combine fine tuned LLMs, scalable data pipelines, and modern web applications.

My work spans everything from LLM fine tuning and **model serving** to developing **backend APIs**,  
**data processing pipelines**, and **front end architecture**. I love taking ideas from zero  
to production and designing systems where models, data, and user experience fit together precisely. 

I'm especially interested in **ethical, human-centered AI** and enjoy building tools that help  
people learn, work, and create more effectively.
